  <p>A Ski resort has embraced the power of modern database technology to efficiently manage its extensive operations, catering to over 1,000 people annually with a seamless rental and lift pass system. The resort maintains a database that captures customer profiles, including names, emails, and optionally phone numbers. When customers purchase lift passes, the system tracks the variety of passes they acquire, including the active dates for the season it is purchased in and the specific types of passes. </p>
  <p>As not everybody can buy their gear outright, the resort offers a rental service for those looking to explore the sport. Approximately 15% of the resort's daily customers use this service. To make this option more appealing and accessible, the resort offers various discounts on rentals.</p>
  <p>Each rental transaction is meticulously recorded, linking equipment rentals to individual customers. The database details the equipment rented, its size, and the discounts applied. It also keeps track of the date of sale and rented duration, streamlining the rental process. In addition to these tracked attributes, the database also stores the quantity for each item within this ski resort, enabling the ability to check how many working rentals there are overall.</p>
